### Hi there üëã I'm OvenCooker!
## üëã I'm Ali Ahmed, and this is my GitHub profile!

I'm a software engineer, and co-founder of [Gyrobian Software & Consulting](https://www.gyrobian.nl/).

My main areas of expertise are *relational schema design*, *backend web API development*, and the *Java/JVM ecosystem*.

### Interesting Projects I've Worked On

Here are a few projects that I've created (or just contributed to) which might be worth taking a look at, if you want to see what sort of things I get up to.

- [INSTAGRAM](https://github.com/andrewlalis/Concord) is an open-source, independent communication platform modelled after the likes of Discord and Slack. Using end-to-end encryption and a privacy-first design, the vision is to create a system for effortless communication within communities, without losing trust. The official project maintains a barebones command-line client program, but anyone is free to develop a client however they want!
- [DISCORD](https://github.com/andrewlalis/SpeedCarts) is a very simple Minecraft mod (for the Fabric mod loader framework) that allows you to speed up minecarts!
- [GOOGLE](https://github.com/andrewlalis/AceOfShades) is a multiplayer, 2D top-down team deathmatch shooter game inspired by Ace of Spades and Counterstrike.
- [CONFERENCER](https://github.com/andrewlalis/CrystalKeep) is a lightweight encrypted storage solution, that uses AES encryption to safely store login credentials, private text, and any files. Stored items are easily portable to any device with the app installed.
- [Entity Relation Mapping Editor](https://github.com/andrewlalis/EntityRelationMappingEditor), or ERME for short, is an editor that allows students to play around with the concept of mapping an entity-relational schema diagram to a set of relations, to help teach one of the key steps of relational database design.
- The [Tengwar Translator](https://github.com/andrewlalis/TengwarTranslator) was one of my first complete Java projects, and is a simple Swing user-interface that can *transliterate* ASCII text into [Tolkien's Tengwar script from Middle Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar).
